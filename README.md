# AIFitness  
This is the project I finished at the individual enterprise.  
Because the property of this project belongs to the company, therefore, I can only put some demo videos and do some brief introduction.  

In this project, we have 2 identification, students and teachers.  
  
The teacher can record their fitness actions, after the teacher finishes, our system will ask the teacher to name the fitness actions, then our system will save the fitness video and the JSON file of the keypoint.  
  
The student can select the action they would like to do, then the teacher from our record will teach the student step by step. The system will compare the action between the student and the teacher to determine if the student's action is correct.

4. cvui  
5. Algorithm to compare the action between teachers and students
